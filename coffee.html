            <p class="co">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain
                Coffea
                species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
                green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product:
                roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being
                filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>

        <div class="history">
            <h2 class="h2">History</h2>
            <p>Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the
                Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
                beloved beans.

                The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a
                certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.

                Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and
                found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery
                with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.

                As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these
                beans across the globe.</p>

        <h2 class="turh">Turkish Coffee</h2>

        <div class="tur">
            <p>Turkish coffee refers to a method of brewing very finely ground coffee. Any coffee bean may be used;
                arabica varieties are considered best, but robusta or a blend is also used. The beans must be ground to
                a very fine powder, which is left in the coffee when served.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="essh">Esspresso</h2>
        <div class="essp">
            <p>Espresso is among the most common types of coffee drink in the world. The Espresso comes with
                different variations and changes across countries. However, this coffee is a highly concentrated one as
                such
                and is a straightforward choice. The coffee initially originated from Italy and is prepared by forcing
                pressure steam from the beans. So the final coffee drink product comes as a very thick one in
                texture and hence also has high levels of caffeine. It is the most popular varieties of coffee drinks.

    <h2 class="caph"> Cappuccino</h2>
    <img class="capi" src="./pexels-tyler-nix-2396220.jpg" alt="no image">
    <div class="cap">
        <p>Cappuccino is an Italian coffee drink that is made by mixing double espresso shots with steam milk foam. You
            could even use cream in place of milk in case you want to make the drink thick. The steamed milk is poured
            on top of the espresso shot and is then topped with whipped cream or thick milk foam</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="lath">Cafe Latte</h2>
    <div class="latte">
        <p>Café Latte differs from several other coffee drinks mentioned earlier, as this contains a larger proportion
            of milk than others. These types come with a milk aroma because of the reason. Here, a shot of espresso is
            with a large mug of steamed milk. The bitterness of coffee and caffeine is cut away given the amount of milk
            proportion here. Some even add a layer of flavor on the top.</p>

    <div class="mocha">
        <p>The Mocha coffee comes within the same variety of café latte. Here, instead of single espresso mixed with
            milk, we use a double espresso shot with foamed milk, along with cocoa powder or chocolate syrup. Some even
            use whipped cream or cinnamon or chocolate chips as toppings. Because of the additional flavors, Mocha
            mostly comes with a creamy thick textured chocolate coffee flavor and is perfect for just beginning to taste
            the drink.</p>
